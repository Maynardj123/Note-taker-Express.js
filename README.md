  ## Description
  I built  this to work on my skills using routes, databases, and servers. I especially learned more about using express and how information moves through it.

  open the integrated terminal by right clicking on server.js . than type in npm i to get started. 


  ## Usage
  Right click on server.js followed by opening integrated terminal. Once that is open type in npm run start, this will start the server and you will have to go to the browser and type in localhost:3001 to show the note taker.
